# What's this all about
This repository was created for me to document, reflect and learn from my journey to obtain a Computer Science degree.
## Objectives:
  + I would like to document my progress, what I've learned and how, What I enjoyed, and what I hated.
  + Accountability, I want this "little" project to hold me accountable.
  + Challenge, although It's challenging enough, I know, with enough discipline, I can create something I will be proud of
  
## How will this work?
