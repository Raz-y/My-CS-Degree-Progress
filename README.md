# My CS Degree Journey

This repository is a space for me to document and reflect on my journey toward earning a Computer Science degree.

## Goals:
- **Documentation**: Track my progress, highlight what I've learned, and share insights from each course.
- **Accountability**: Keep myself on track by regularly updating this repository.
- **Challenge**: Push myself to create something meaningful and reflective of my growth.
