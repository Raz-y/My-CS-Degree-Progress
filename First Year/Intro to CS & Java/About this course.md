# Intro to Computer Science and Java
As recommended by the advisor of the Open University of Israel, I divided this course into 2 parts.
## What I learned:
While I had a hard time connecting with the material learned in math courses, I found it easy to relate to learning Java


## What helped me:
+ Practicing coding problems on https://codingbat.com/java
+ Focusing on solving assignments by myself
+ Building my own testers to better understand the assignments
